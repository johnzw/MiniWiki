# MiniWiki
Wiki-like website deployed on Google App Engine

### Why I make this
It is a final project of Web Development on Udacity. It has been deployed on **Google App Engine**. Click http://fancy-donkey.appspot.com/ to check out.

### What it does
As a sign-uped user, you can:
* view different Wiki pages
* create and edit different Wiki pages
* view the previous versions of each Wikipage and edit on them

#### how you create another page?
just tpye http://fancy-donkey.appspot.com/the-page-you-want-to-create as the new page's url!

As a normal visitor, you can:
* view different Wiki pages
* view the previous versions of each Wikipage
* sign up- -

I find it awesome that **you can create raw HTML contents in this website.** Well, a nice and troublesome feature.

### About security issue
This project adds salt to the hashed password, which may add a little more safty to this website.
